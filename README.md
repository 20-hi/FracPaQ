Version 2.6.1 

October 28th, 2019. 

This is the most recent 'official' release version, and replaces version 2.6, and all previous versions (2.4, 2.2, 2.0, 1.8 & 1.6, as reviewed and patched after the paper was reviewed in Journal of Structural Geology).

Bug fixes and enhancements are:
1. fix the Flip-X and Flip-Y in the wavelet maps
2. in the graphs, use +ve and -ve distance from the selected line 
3. fix the Flip-X and Fip-Y in the cross-plot of length and angle 
4. added a filename 'tag' field to the GUI, for appending to all graphical output from one click of Run
